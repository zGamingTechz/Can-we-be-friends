# Can we be friends?
A personal web app I built as an introvert to get to know my friends better — or make new ones! Just answer some fun questions and see what your "friendship score" says about you 😄

## 👋 About the Project

As someone who struggles to open up sometimes, I wanted to make something light, fun, and meaningful — a small web app that helps break the ice and start interesting conversations.  

This project lets you or your friends:
- Answer quirky yes/no questions
- Track your "friendship journey" score
- Get a personalized summary at the end  
It’s all offline and private — nothing gets uploaded anywhere.

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This

As an introvert who’s been raised on the internet and Discord, I wanted a simple way to have fun interactions and make conversations easier. Whether you’re reconnecting with old friends or starting fresh ones — this little project can help spark something 😊
